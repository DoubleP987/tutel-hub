# Multi-group Calendar — implementation guide

## Current Calendar boundary - 10 October 2026

Calendar has its own repository: https://github.com/DoubleP987/tutel-calendar. Its web/groups/invitations/mobile drawer/shared dates are deployed on homeserver. Original Discord reminders still run through the legacy integration; new grouped Discord worker cutover remains pending; the privileged panel bridge is implemented. OAuth is web authentication, not a second running bot. Calendar CURRENT-STATUS.md and USER-GUIDE explain the latest behavior. Historical learning examples below retain their original context.

Local revision: 10 October 2026. Source implemented; not deployed or runtime-tested in this revision. Existing production behavior is described separately in DEPLOYMENT.md. This guide supersedes earlier single-calendar assumptions.

## 1. Application boundaries

Calendar owns accounts, groups, membership, events, invitations, preferences, inbox records, Discord channel bindings and delivery jobs. Tutel Bot owns music/radio, Discord connections, host election and the private server control panel. They communicate through authenticated HTTP APIs; they never open the same SQLite file.

```text
Browser -> Calendar session + CSRF -> group permission -> Calendar SQLite
Private panel -> server-side control key -> Calendar management API
Active Discord bot -> delivery key -> claim jobs -> Discord -> acknowledge
```

An account has many memberships; every membership has its own role, suspension, trust and preferences. Each event and Discord binding has a group_id. Knowing another group's ID is not permission to read or modify it. Music remains independent of Calendar availability.

## 2. Groups and roles

Sign in, choose **Create group**, enter a name and unique slug. New groups are private. Switch groups using the selector; the last group and signed-in display/reminder preferences are saved in SQLite. Guest filters are stored separately for each group in browser storage.

| Role                   | Capabilities                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Member                 | Read group events, submit proposals, edit own pending proposals, set personal reminders                             |
| Editor                 | Member capabilities; edit native published events; treated as trusted under trusted approval                        |
| Manager                | Review proposals, manage ordinary members/trust, invitations, group reminder settings and existing Discord bindings |
| Owner                  | Manager capabilities plus appoint managers, change visibility/name and transfer ownership                           |
| Platform administrator | Manage all groups through the private panel; separate from group roles                                              |

Private groups require membership. Public groups permit read-only viewing through `/g/<slug>`. There is no public group directory, search or membership request flow. Blocking a membership does not block other groups. Owners must transfer ownership before their role can be removed or blocked. Self-removal of management access is rejected.

Google/Discord bootstrap administrator IDs and migrated original managers are privileged Calendar accounts. Review that bootstrap list before production migration. Calendar roles do not create private bot-panel accounts or server credentials.

## 3. Invitations and preassigned people

Owners/managers can create a link or join code with 1–30 days validity and 1–500 uses; defaults are seven days and one use. Codes contain 12 random hexadecimal characters. Tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes; plaintext links are shown only when created. Revoke unused invitations from the invitation list. Share private links deliberately.

An email invitation is assigned to an exact normalized provider-verified address, one use only. It creates a pending invitation, **not a fabricated user account**. When the invited person signs in, matching invitations are claimed. Existing members can refresh to claim newly created invitations. An invitation does not overwrite an existing role or bypass a membership suspension.

CSV supports UTF-8/BOM, quoted fields and CRLF. Preview before confirmation. Maximum 500 rows and 100 KB; duplicate or invalid email rows prevent the entire import. Roles in CSV are member/editor only. Example:

```csv
email,name,role
student@parichat.skru.ac.th,Student,member
editor@example.com,Editor,editor
```

Preassignment needs no mail server. Actual invitation emails require SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_FROM and, when required by the provider, SMTP_USER/SMTP_PASSWORD. The sender uses TLS and Nodemailer; the UI has an explicit **send email** checkbox. CSV imports create preassignments without bulk mail. A configured SMTP service, mail delivery and spam reputation are external prerequisites; no email account has been provisioned by this revision.

## 4. Accounts and OAuth

Google uses basic OpenID/profile/email scopes. University Google accounts are supported; verified Gmail addresses or a provider-verified hosted-domain account can claim email invitations. Discord now requests `identify email`; users may need to consent again. Never trust a user-typed email for automatic membership.

From account settings, link the other provider while signed in. A fresh OAuth callback and the current session prove both accounts. If two existing accounts are linked, memberships/events/notifications/subscriptions move transactionally to the current account; higher roles survive, suspensions are retained, and the other account's sessions are revoked. Similar display names or emails alone never merge accounts.

OAuth state is single-use with expiry; return paths are local-only and retain the group/date/event. Session cookies remain HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax and Secure on HTTPS. Browser writes require origin and CSRF checks. Service APIs use separate credentials, not browser cookies.

## 5. Discord group binding

After activating group integration, run `/calendar connect` in the target channel. The requester needs Manage Server; the bot needs View Channel, Send Messages and Embed Links. The bot obtains a single-use ten-minute connection link. Open it, sign in/link the same Discord account, choose a group you manage and confirm. The grant binds that exact guild/channel, so browser input cannot substitute a different channel.

The private system panel can also create a binding after checking the bot's channel permissions. Group managers may configure or disable an existing binding, but cannot arbitrarily change its Discord destination. One group can have several bindings; a channel can receive more than one group's agenda. A private group's reminder is visible to everyone with access to its configured Discord channel: check Discord permissions before binding.

Default summary is 07:00 Asia/Bangkok; tomorrow's summary is noon the preceding day. Timed reminders are optional; category filters, lead time and embed color are per binding. The calendar link includes the exact group/date, and event reminders also include the event ID. Private links still require member login. Daily events are combined into an agenda, not one message per event. Up to five group agendas fit one message; larger batches split to respect Discord button/embed limits, and long agendas link to the full list.

The explicit **send test message** button queues a diagnostic job. It does not prove delivery until the active bot receives it and a message ID is recorded.

## 6. Delivery reliability and host switching

Only the active elected bot polls, every 15 seconds. Calendar creates stable per-binding deduplication keys, atomically claims jobs for 120 seconds, records delivery start, and receives acknowledgement with the Discord message ID. A bot-host change does not change Calendar ownership or copy its database.

| State     | Meaning                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| pending   | Available to claim                                                                                   |
| claimed   | Worker owns a temporary lease; safe to reclaim after expiry if sending has not started               |
| sending   | Sending began; another host must not blindly send again                                              |
| sent      | Message ID acknowledged                                                                              |
| failed    | Known failure such as unavailable destination; inspect and manually retry                            |
| uncertain | Worker stopped or network/acknowledgement failed after sending began; check the channel before retry |
| expired   | Delivery window has passed                                                                           |

New scheduled jobs have a five-minute catch-up window. Pending/claimed jobs expire after one hour. Exactly-once delivery across two independent services is not guaranteed: a crash between Discord acceptance and local acknowledgement can be uncertain. The panel exposes that state and requires confirmation that the channel was checked before manually retrying. Bot-side message IDs and Discord nonces reduce duplicates. No endless automatic retry flood is used.

If Calendar itself is offline, music can continue and a standby bot can take over music, but neither bot can fetch new Calendar jobs. The website/database do not automatically fail over to Oracle in this implementation. A calendar replica/backup restoration plan is a separate infrastructure task.

## 7. Main private control panel

Open **Manage all groups** using an existing bot-panel administrator account. It displays overview counts, groups, accounts/memberships, group members/roles/trust, ownership transfer, invitations/CSV, native event editing/review, channel bindings/test messages, delivery jobs/retry and audit history. Imported events are read-only while the legacy source remains authoritative.

The browser calls the bot's private proxy. The proxy checks session, admin role, CSRF and a fixed path allowlist, then calls Calendar with CALENDAR_CONTROL_SECRET server-side. Browser JavaScript and Discord messages never receive that credential. CALENDAR_BOT_SECRET has a smaller API surface for bindings, connection grants and delivery claims; it cannot manage users or events. Use distinct long keys and protect the private panel with Tailscale/LAN access.

Lists are bounded: up to 1,000 users/events, 500 invitations/jobs/audit entries. This is a small-deployment interface, not an unlimited analytics export.

## 8. Local setup and migration

Node.js 24+ is required. Install dependencies separately in D:/tutel-calendar and D:/tutel-bot. Existing local `.env` files contain matching, randomly generated service credentials; examples contain blanks. Do not overwrite a configured `.env` with the example.

Calendar `.env` needs both CALENDAR_CONTROL_SECRET and CALENDAR_BOT_SECRET. Bot `.env` needs the same respective values plus:

```dotenv
CALENDAR_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
CALENDAR_WEB_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3100
CALENDAR_GROUPS_ENABLED=0
```

HTTP is permitted only for loopback development. For separate hosts use a trusted HTTPS Calendar URL accessible from both bot hosts. Real OAuth mode requires HTTPS and ENABLE_DEMO=0; local demo stays loopback-only. Start Calendar with `npm start`, then open http://127.0.0.1:3100. The main panel uses its existing process/configuration. Running the real bot requires its existing Discord and database setup.

Keep CALENDAR_GROUPS_ENABLED=0 during migration: the old reminder scheduler continues. After creating and checking group/channel bindings, set it to 1 on **both** bot hosts, register the command definitions, and restart the services in a coordinated cutover. This flag switches the scheduler globally, not per group. Do not enable it while unmigrated channels still depend on the old scheduler. New-mode calendar commands use the web workflow; legacy add/remove/list command behavior is not preserved in new mode.

Back up Calendar SQLite with a consistent SQLite backup or while stopped; a live WAL database may have committed rows in its WAL file. Keep the bot's own backup separately. Old event IDs remain, events migrate into the public `cs-skru` group, original members join that group once, and original settings are copied. New groups do not inherit personal activities; they read general dates from one shared dataset. Review original managers before migrating administrator privileges. Stop legacy import/publishing only after Calendar becomes authoritative; do not introduce a two-way sync loop. Imported source removal is not yet reconciled automatically.

No production services, OAuth dashboards, DNS, GitHub or deployments were changed for this local revision. No runtime or cross-group isolation tests were run; complete a staging check before production activation.

Browser group routes include `/api/groups`, `/api/group`, `/api/group/select`, `/api/invitations`, `/api/invitations/csv`, `/api/invitations/accept`, `/api/accounts/link/:provider`, `/api/discord-connect` and `/api/discord-bindings`. Group-scoped requests send `x-calendar-group`; this is a selector, not authorization.

Bot service routes are under `/internal/v1/bot`: bindings, connect-grants, claim, jobs/:id/start and jobs/:id/ack. Management routes are under `/internal/v1/control`: overview, groups, users, group members/transfer/invitations/bindings/events, jobs/retry and audit. Exact methods and validation live in the route modules. Never put either service key in a public frontend environment variable.
